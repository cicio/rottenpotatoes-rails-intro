Feature: Filter the list of movies by rating 

	As a parent of movie loving children
	In order to allow the children to select age appropriate movies
	I want to be able to filter movie list by ratings
	
	Background:
	Given the following movies and ratings exist:
    |title                  |rating |release_date   |
    |Inception				|PG-13	|2010-07-16		|
    |It's Complicated		|R		|2009-12-25		|
    |SaaS The Movie			|G		|2012-01-14		|
    |Cicio The SaaSy		|PG		|2015-01-14		|
	
	
Scenario: Add checkboxes for filtering the list of movies
	  When I visit the "index" page
	  Then I should see check boxes for all movie ratings
	  And the check boxes should be within an element with id:"rating_form"
	  
	  
Scenario: Show only movies with selected MPAA ratings
      When I check the following boxes:"G, PG"
      And I click on "Refresh"
      Then I should see movie with rating "Cicio The SaaSy, PG"
      And I should see movie with rating "SaaS The Movie, G"
      But I should not see movie with rating "Inception, PG-13"
      And I should not see movie with rating "It's Complicated, R"
